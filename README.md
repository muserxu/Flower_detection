# Flower_detection

The Flower detection application that is able to identify the flower location in a piture and identify its species. 

It is using python and Tensorflow API to train the detection model (faster R-CNN)

It uses Keras and Sci-learn pre-built logistic regression model to identify the flower species.

The dataset we will are from Kaggle and Oxford University Flower Recongnition group
